train binary "vehicle detection" classifier
    training data = thumbnail images of vehicles & not-vehicles
    extract combination of color space, color histogram & HOG descriptor features
    train classifier like SVM, DT, ensemble, etc.
    explore parameter optimization via grid search and/or randomized search
    
vehicle detection pipeline (given the trained classifier)
    optimization: pre-compute HOG descriptors on full image
    optimization: pre-compute resized images for each search window size
    compute set of search windows within the image
    possible: add search windows computed from prior detections
    for each search window
        resize image section to match training image size
        compute feature vector for resized section
        if vehicle then add window to match-list
    build heat-map from match-list
    threshold heat-map
    compute vehicle bounding boxes from thresholded heat-map
    annotate input image with vehicle bounding boxes
